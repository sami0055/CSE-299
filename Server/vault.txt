NSU Code of Conduct for Students NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY Center of Excellence in Higher Education NSU CoC DC VW CG Www MF DP SP EP Keywords North South University Code of Conduct Disciplinary Committee Verbal Warning Calling of Guardian Written Warning Monetary Fine Disciplinary Probation Suspension Expulsion Preamble North South University (NSU) is committed to the freedom of speech as stated in article 39 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and constructive debate of alternative views, theory, and data.It recognizes and respects all peaceful and non-obstructive forms of dissent, whether individual or collective, that are within the university regulations and which do not interfere with the regular and essential academic/ non-academic operations of the university.
NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY IS DETERMINED @ to promote a safe and comfortable learning environment, and @ to enforce student discipline, and @ to promote and ensure academic integrity and campus civility, and @ to assure students who are alleged to be responsible for unacceptable conduct receive fair and impartial consideration. AND FOR THESE ENDS @ to promote practice of decent behavior and create and maintain a peaceful learning environment, and ® to provide guidelines for imposition of discipline in the university, and ® to define prohibited conduct and disciplinary action to be taken in the event of such misconduct, HAVE DEVOTED TO COMBINE OUR EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS.Accordingly, the NSU authority, through the representation of the Disciplinary Committee (DC), who have performed their responsibilities in good and due form; do hereby establish NSU Code of Conduct (CoC) for Students.02 1.The Disciplinary Code 1.1.
Purpose The purpose of this code is to outline the acceptable standard of conduct and disciplinary actions applicable to students, in case of violations of the standard conduct. It is acknowledged that a disciplinary code and disciplinary actions are necessary for the smooth operation of an educational institution and the safety and fair treatment of all students.Moreover, this code provides guidelines and references for the disciplinary authority to ensure justice, while also applying disciplinary sanctions if needed.1.2.Underlying Principles This code is based on the following principles: @ Any violation of the CoC, as stated in this document, is a cause for initiating necessary disciplinary action(s).The judicial system is subject to the authority of the Vice-Chancellor of the university as he/she deems appropriate, except that the DC shall have the authority to approve disciplinary warning as a sanction.
The DC shall consider the cases and make recommendations to the Vice-Chancellor for necessary sanction(s). @ Proctor’s Office has the authority to the application of discipline at the university and at any event that is organized under the university banner, inside or outside the premises.The Proctor’'s Office ensures that there is no violation of the CoC.@ When enforcement of discipline is needed, emphasis is given on guidance and rehabilitation rather than the imposition of punishment.@ The DC is the apex body related to disciplinary matters concerning students.03 @ If a student is alleged of an activity that violates both this code and the law of the land, then disciplinary action at the university will normally proceed, while civil or criminal proceedings will be initiated by informing the law enforcement agency.The application of discipline in all instances must be consistent and fair.1.3.
Disciplinary Sanctions Based on the severity of the misconduct, the range of official sanctions shall be recommended by the DC for violation of regulations (both academic and social). The diciplinary sanctions are the following: 1.3.1 Verbal Warning In case of moderate offense, an assistant proctor under the guidance of the proctor should conduct a disciplinary interview with the student involved along with the student affected/witness(es) that may result in an initial official warning.This is a notice to the student that his/her conduct was questionable and that if the student is eventually found in violation of a rule while on disciplinary warning; subsequent action may be more severe.The verbal warning shall become a matter of record in the student's file to track the student's behavior for future reference.1.3.2.
Calling of Guardian and Written Warning More serious offense or repetition of the misconduct can result in calling of guardian along with a final written warning where the student and guardian shall execute a bond to take on the liability of any future disciplinary actions. The final written warning shall be recorded in the student's file to track the student's behavior for future reference.1.3.3.Loss of Privilege Loss of privilege is the withdrawal of privilege, use of a service or participation in an activity for a specific period of time consistent with the offense committed and the rehabilitation of the student.Loss of privilege may be imposed separately or in addition to any other sanction(s).04 1.3.4.Monetary Fine Students will be charged with a monetary fine for violating specific codes of conduct.The monetary fine will be imposed based on the violation of code and/or repetition of the occurrence.
1.3.5, Disciplinary Probation Disciplinary Probation status shall be for a specific length of time in which any further violation of the CoC puts the student’s status with the university in jeopardy. The status of disciplinary probation is assigned for a specific period of time.Though the student will be allowed to continue with courses at the university, disciplinary probation status may affect qualification for some awards, prizes or student financial aid and/or impose some conditions or tasks to comply.If the student is found “in-violation’ for another violation of the CoC, while on disciplinary probation, more severe sanctions may be imposed- such as suspension or expulsion.While on disciplinary probation, a hold will be placed on a student's record for record-keeping purposes.Where the violation of the code requires rectification for future progressive and or corrective measures in conduct, Proctor's Office will keep the student on disciplinary probation.
During this disciplinary probation period, the student's behavior will be closely monitored and he/she will be called to the Proctor’s Office for hearing. 1.3.6.Temporary Suspension The student may, if necessary, be temporarily suspended, before, during, or pending the outcome of the inquiry.Such a sanction requires the student to leave the campus immediately.It may be imposed upon a student by the Department Head (Academic), or the Chairperson of the DC, or the Proctor, should he/she have sufficient reason to believe that the alleged student is an immediate threat to the safety of persons, property or to the essential functions of the university.Any instantly suspended student, who returns to the campus during the period of interim suspension, shall be subjected to disciplinary dismissal or disciplinary expulsion.Any student who is summarily suspended will be required to stay off university property until an official hearing is conducted by the DC.05 1.3.7.
Disciplinary Suspension The cases where a student is accused of major breach of conduct by committing a severe misconduct will be directed to the highest authority of disciplinary affairs, the DC. For example, a student may be suspended for up to 2 semesters as per the decision made by the DC.The suspension shall exclude the student from registration, class attendance, participation in university events and activities, and use of university facilities for a specified period of time.In cases where the student is currently attending courses, s/he will be allowed to finish the semester without prejudice.The disciplinary suspension will then start from the following semester for the stipulated period of time.If the student has voluntarily refrained from registering for the semester during which the DC holds its hearing, that semester will not be counted within the stipulated period of disciplinary suspension.Disciplinary suspension becomes a matter of record in the student's file.1.3.8.
Disciplinary Expulsion Disciplinary Expulsion is a sanction that removes the student from the individual’s academic program and permanently separates a student from the university without the opportunity to graduate or re-enroll at the university in the future. Disciplinary expulsion shall be executed by the approval of the Vice-Chancellor of the university.An overlay will be permanently placed on the student's transcript.Further, a hold will be permanently placed on a student's record for record-keeping purposes and reported in student's transcript.Disciplinary expulsion is executed where a series of previous progressive and corrective measures have not produced the anticipated effect, or a series of verbal and/or written warnings have not been effective, or a student is alleged to have committed an inexcusable offense.06 1.3.9.
Restitution/Compensation to the University Restitution requires a student to pay for damages to or misappropriation of university property or the property of members of or visitors to the university. Such restitution shall be charged to any student who alone, or through group activities, organizes or knowingly participates in the events causing such damages or costs.Restitution may be imposed separately or in addition to other sanction(s).1.4.Schedule of Offences @ The disciplinary action in the columns represents the maximum proposed punishment that may be imposed depending on the type/severity of the breach and the number of times it has been committed by the student.@ While charging a disciplinary action, previous breaches and punishments, which are still valid, must be considered when deciding the action to be taken against a related breach to a past offense.@ If the deciding authority is of the opinion that there are valid justifying factors, the penalty shall be reduced.
@ The schedule of offenses and proposed action indicated are merely served as a guideline and does not constitute inflexible rules that have to be followed. The circumstances and the merits of each case must be taken into account and the deciding authority is expected to use his/her discretion to make a proper judgment.@ North South University reserves the right to amend this code and/or charge a student with an offense that although not contained within this code but is deemed an offense in terms of the common law and acceptable practice.07 1.5.Filing a Complaint If a student or group of students have concerns about treatment by another student(s), it is appropriate to seek help from the Proctor's Office.Security personal available at designated places around the campus are the first point of contact in any on-campus students dispute.The security personnel will direct student(s) involved in dispute to the Proctor's Office.The student (i.e.
complainant) feeling mistreated may directly come to the Proctor's Office, meet the available assistant proctor, narrate the incident and file a complaint. The complainant is required to file a written complaint in a formal complaint form which is available at the Proctor's Office.Upon receiving the formal complaint, the Proctor's Office will initiate the investigation and conduct disciplinary process stated in this CoC which provides detailed procedures and authorities for dealing with different types of problems.Students are also welcome to lodge a complain electronically by emailing the detail of the mistreatment to the Proctor or any of the assistant proctors.08 2.Definition, Sample Offenses, and Punishments 2.1.
